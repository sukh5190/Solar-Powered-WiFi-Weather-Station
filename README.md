# Solar-Powered-WiFi-Weather-Station

The Solar Powered WiFi Weather Station is a compact, low-power, and fully autonomous environmental monitoring system designed to measure and transmit real-time weather data from remote or off-grid locations. The system integrates multiple meteorological sensors on a custom-designed PCB, powered by a solar-charged 18650 Li-ion battery, and uses WiFi connectivity for cloud-based data monitoring.

This weather station is specifically built to support localized weather monitoring (microclimates), providing more accurate and relevant environmental data than centralized meteorological stations, especially in rural, agricultural, or isolated areas.

Key Features

Fully solar powered with battery backup
Custom-designed PCB with modular sensor integration
Ultra-low power operation using ESP32 deep sleep mode
WiFi-based data transmission
Supports multiple environmental parameters
Compact and weather-protected enclosure
Measured Weather Parameters

The system monitors the following parameters using reliable digital sensors:

Internal Temperature, Humidity & Barometric Pressure – via BME280
External Ambient Temperature – via DS18B20
Wind Speed – via Cup Anemometer
Wind Direction – via Wind Vane
Rainfall – via Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge
UV Index – via SI1145
Light Intensity (Lux Level) – via BH1750
Battery Voltage Level – via voltage divider circuit

Power System Design

The weather station operates entirely on renewable energy using a 5V solar panel and a 18650 Li-ion battery.
The battery is charged through a TP4056 charging module with protection.
Battery voltage (up to 4.2V) is regulated to 3.3V using a low-dropout voltage regulator (TC1262-3.3V).
This ensures stable operation even at lower battery voltages.
A slide switch allows safe power isolation.
To maximize efficiency, the ESP32 operates in Deep Sleep mode, waking periodically to collect sensor data and upload it over WiFi before returning to sleep. This significantly extends battery life and enables continuous operation for several days even without sunlight.

Sensor Interface and Operation

Wind speed and rainfall sensors use reed switches and are monitored via interrupt-based GPIO inputs.
Wind direction is determined using a resistor-based voltage divider and ADC readings.
Environmental and light sensors communicate via the I2C protocol, allowing multiple sensors to share the same bus.
External temperature sensing uses a one-wire interface for minimal wiring and power consumption.
Battery voltage monitoring is implemented using a resistor divider to safely read voltage through the ESP32 ADC.

Custom PCB Design

A custom PCB was designed to neatly integrate:

ESP32 development board
Power regulation and charging circuit
Sensor connectors (I2C, One-Wire, analog, and digital inputs)
RJ11 connectors for wind and rain sensors
Protection components like a TVS diode for surge safety
The PCB layout is optimized for compact size, modular sensor connection, and ease of assembly.

Enclosure Design

The electronics and sensors are housed in a 3D-printed Stevenson Screen, which:
Protects sensors from direct sunlight and rain
Allows proper airflow for accurate readings
Isolates heat generated by the solar panel
Supports wall mounting and outdoor installation

The enclosure is printed using white filament for better thermal performance and consists of modular parts for easy assembly and maintenance.

Applications

This weather station is suitable for a wide range of real-world applications, including:
Smart agriculture and irrigation monitoring
Smart city environmental sensing
Solar power plant performance analysis
Construction site weather tracking
Remote weather data logging
Research and educational projects

Conclusion

The Solar Powered WiFi Weather Station is a robust, scalable, and energy-efficient solution for real-time weather monitoring. With its modular sensor design, custom PCB, solar power system, and low-power operation, it provides a reliable platform for collecting accurate localized weather data in both urban and remote environments.
